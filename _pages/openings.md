Before you get in touch, please read the instructions below carefully. I will only respond to those who send all of the  documents mentioned in the specific openings.

## Fully funded PhD position in Computational Fluid Dynamics for Atmospheric Modeling

## IMPORTANT: I will only consider applicantions that fullfill ALL of the following requirements:

- Be already legally able to work in the US (e.g. visa holders, permanent residents, 
citizens) or able to obtain a visa by April 2024.
- Have already taken the GRE test or be able to take it by April 1st.
- Link to github/gitlab account or provable coding experience
- CV
- Name and contact of 3 reference letter writers. 

Are you a computer geek who enjoys writing code? Do you have a provable experience in ANY programming languages such as C/C++, Fortran 90/95 or, even better, Julia?
Would you like to apply your abilities towards a doctoral degree in numerical methods to model atmospheric flows?

If you answered yes to these questions, then this is the opening for you!

You will be part ofa collaborative project between New Jersey Institute of Technology and the University of Wisconsin at Madison. 

To be considered, send ALL of the following documents:
- A detailed CV.
- A link to your github or gitlab profile or equivalent portfolio.
- One-page motivation letter on why you are willing to work towards a Ph.D. degree.
- If you wrote a M.S. thesis, please send a copy of it or a copy of any research paper that may have co-authored.
- Names of 3 senior scientists/professors who can write a reference letter for you.

Only those who submit all of the above will be considered.

The CV should include details about the classes that you took and the final grade that you obtained.

This project is mathematically and coding intensive; a solid coding experience  and solid background in mathematics are required. No experience in atmospheric sciences is necessary.

The project will be funded for four years. You should be able to start in
January 2024. A later start may be considered.

Notice: if you require a VISA to the US to apply for this position, please specify how long it will take to obtain it.
