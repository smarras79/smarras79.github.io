# Tropical cyclones
Funded by the National Science Foundation, we are investigating, by high-performance computing and numerical means, the fluid flow dynamics that control the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. The software at the foundation of this (computationally demanding) project is the Nonhydrostatic Unified Model of the Atmosphere ([NUMA](https://frankgiraldo.wixsite.com/mysite/numa)), born by the fingers of my long-time mentor Prof. Frank X. Giraldo at the Naval Postgraduate School, and co-developed by the PI and graduate student Yassine Tissaoui for many years.

# Whale simulations

This study, in collaboration with scientists from different institutions, contributed to a better understanding of why remoras attachon some very specific parts of large blue whales. The multi-physics software [Alya](https://www.bsc.es/research-development/research-areas/engineering-simulations/alya-high-performance-computational) from the [Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es) was a key tool to obtain these results. The New York Times even wrote an article about this study [NY Times link](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/science/remoras-suckerfish-whales.html)!
